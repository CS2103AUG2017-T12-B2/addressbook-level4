=== Enhancement Added: Export all contacts to a `.txt` file

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=multiple]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When users are on the move and do not have access to the software, it is essential to have a physical copy of all the contacts. Exporting them to a `.txt` file would faciliate the process of printing.
